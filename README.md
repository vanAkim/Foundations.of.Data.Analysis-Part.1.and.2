# Notes and R scripts 

This repo host all R files and associated data to complete all 12 courses *(Part 1: 6 ; Part 2: 6)*, [UT.7.11x](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-of-data-analysis-part-1-statistics-usi) & [UT.7.21x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.21x+2T2017/course/), of **Foundations of Data Analysis** from the UTAustinX on edX.

Since this course is **archived**, but still fully available, I did all the program as free audit.

I take all my notes in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Courses notebook : [Personal Notion notebook](https://www.notion.so/datakim/Foundations-of-Data-Analysis-Part-1-2-Statistics-Using-R-66dbf4bc816645a89b3ba822e3b20c0a)  
The Notion notebook converted as markdown can be found in the dedicated subfolder [Notion notebook in markdown](https://github.com/vanAkim/Foundations_of_Data_Analysis-Statistics_Using_R/tree/master/Notion%20notebook%20in%20markdown).
